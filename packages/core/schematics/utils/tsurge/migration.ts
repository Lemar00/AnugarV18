/**
 * A Tsurge migration is split into three stages:
 *    - analyze phase
 *    - merge phase
 *    - migrate phase
 *
 * The motivation for such split is that migrations may be executed
 * on individual workers, e.g. via go/tsunami or a Beam pipeline. The
 * individual workers are never seeing the full project, e.g. Google3.
 *
 * The analysis phases can operate on smaller TS project units, and later
 * then expect the isolated unit data to be merged into some sort of global
 * metadata via the `merge` phase. As a final step then, the migration
 * replacements will be computed.
 *
 * There are subtle differences in how the final stage can compute migration
 * replacements. Some migrations need program access again, while other's don't.
 * For this reason, there are two possible variants of Tsurge migrations:
 *
 *   - {@link TsurgeFunnelMigration}
 *   - {@link TsurgeComplexMigration}
 *
 *  TODO: Link design doc
